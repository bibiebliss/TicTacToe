# TicTacToe
Really simple instructions. Two players. Player 1 is X and player 2 is O.
Player 1 always goes first. Stick to the box grid or else your click will 
be invalid and player will have to click again in a valid box. When game is
over, clicks on the board will not be registered till the "new game" button 
is clicked. Have fun!
